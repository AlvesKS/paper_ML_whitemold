## Summary

In the study we use the combination of data fusion and machine learning interpretation to gain knowledge about environmental effects on plant diseases. We used as a study case the pathosystem of white mold on snap bean. White mold is a monocyclic plant disease caused by the Ascomycete *Sclerotinia sclerotiorum*, and it has the reputation of being one the most destructive disease around the world.
