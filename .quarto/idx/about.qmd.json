The standard on-ground weather station network is often too sparse relative to the scale of agricultural fields to make use of an in-depth study of the relationship between weather and disease, and results in observational datasets are hence unused or under-utilized. Our work shows how environmental data can be obtained online and downscaled to the field level. We then show how potential predictor variables can be identified in downscaled weather time series. Our final step uses these predictors to fit and interpret a  machine learning model to understand how weather contributes to plant disease risk. Our case study was white mold of snap beans, and the results have identified new avenues of research in disease risk modeling. We believe that the proposed framework is broadly applicable to any ecological field.\n\n## Original article\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n# This [repository](https://osf.io/v53py/){target=\"_blank\"} contains the data and code for our article:\n\nAlves, K.S., Shah, D.A., Dillard, H.R., Del Ponte, E.M., Pethybridge, S.J.
